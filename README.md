# 🌀 Ikari

**Ikari** is your new voice-controlled sidekick that lets you run terminal commands and open apps just by speaking. Powered by [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), this project is still a baby — but a loud one.

## 🚀 What it does

* 🎙️ Converts your mic input into text using whisper.cpp
* 🖥️ Opens apps with simple voice commands
* 💻 THATS IT FOR NOW

## 🛠️ How it works (coming soon)

> Magic. Kinda. Actually just speech-to-text + system calls — but cooler when you say it out loud.

## 🔮 Roadmap

Here’s what’s cooking:

* 🤖 Integrate AI to understand more complex voice instructions
* 📁 Edit files and append text via voice (goodbye, keyboard?)
* 🎵 Voice-controlled media player
* 🧠 Smarter command recognition and execution

*note: I am one student.. that means I am NOT doing all of this by myself nor paying for API keys for AI so I need community help*

## 🐣 Status

This project just hatched. Expect the bare minimum like actually we got like 5 apps that run with voice commands. Contributions, ideas, and sarcastic comments are welcome.

## 📢 Wanna help?

PRs and stars make me the dev happy. If you’ve got ideas or find a bug, open an issue!
